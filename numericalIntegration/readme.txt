Users of this program must hard code in the function to be integrated straight into the code. On line 60, in the function userDefinedFunction, that is where you specify the function you will be integrating. Additionally, on line 38, there is a cout statement that displays the function that is being integrated. This should also be changed so as not to be displaying a different function than is being integrated.

This user can choose three different numerical integration methods: Midpoint Approximation, the Trapezoidal Rule, or Simpson's Rule. 
The user can also specify how many approximations should be made, in addition to the region along which the function will be integrated.
